A repo to store all my "coming of age" projects :)

1. kushscript compiler (yet to push)
2. LeapStudyâ€”leapmotion + quizlet to create a studying experience without even touching your computer
(code is here, but live demo is hosted at: http://kushaltirumala.github.io/leapstudy.html)
3. Air drumset (play drums in the air with MYO + Leapmotion)


More to come soon.
